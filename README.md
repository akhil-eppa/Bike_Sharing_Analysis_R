# Data_Analytics_and_ML_with_R
A data analytics and machine learning project using the R Language

This is a data analytics project performed on a bike sharing dataset from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository. I have performed <b>multiple linear regression</b> and <b>polynomial regression</b> to
build 2 separate machine learning models and hence have compared both of them.

I have also plotted many graphs to get a good insight into the data.
