# Data_Analytics_and_ML_with_R
* This is a data analytics and machine learning project using the R Programming Language.
A **bike-sharing dataset** has been analysed considering various parameters.

* This is a data analytics project performed on a bike sharing dataset from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository. I have performed **multiple linear regression** and **polynomial regression** to
build 2 separate machine learning models and hence have compared both of them.

* I have also plotted many graphs to get a good insight into the data. Read the FinalProject.pdf to get a complete overview of the analysis that I have done.
